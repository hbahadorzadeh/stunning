# stunning

**Stunning** is an alternative for stunnnel written all in _Golang_. It's a lib that help you to tunnel different type of network traffic.
So far `Tcp`, `Udp`, `Tls`, `Http` and `Https` tunnels are implemented and You can use `Tcp Socket`, `Socks5` and `Tun Device` as your interface.

In future it's planned to add `Udp Socket` and `Serial` interfaces and a terminal for monitoring. 

There are test written for socks and tcp sockets and more tests would be added in future.

Helps would be appreciated! :)
